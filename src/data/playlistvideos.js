Halsey \n\n[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]\nHey, I was doing just fine before I met you\nI drink too much\nAnd that's an issue, but I'm okay\nHey, you tell your friends\nIt was nice to meet them\nBut I hope I never see them again\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\nI know it breaks your heart\nMoved to the city in a broke-down car\nAnd four years, no calls\nNow you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar\nAnd I-I-I can't stop\nNo, I-I-I can't stop\n\n[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can't afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf the mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\nWe ain't ever getting older\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Verse 2: Halsey]\nYou look as good as the day I met you\nI forget just why I left you, I was insane\nStay and play that blink-182 song\nThat we beat to death in Tucson, okay\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]\nI know it breaks your heart\nMoved to the city in a broke-down car\nAnd four years, no call\nNow I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar\nAnd I-I-I can't stop\nNo, I-I-I can't stop\n\n[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can't afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf the mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]\nWe ain't ever getting older\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can't afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf the mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]\nWe ain't ever getting older\n(No, we ain't ever getting older)\nWe ain't ever getting older\n(No, we ain't ever getting older)\nWe ain't ever getting older\n(We ain't ever getting older)\nWe ain't ever getting older\n(No, we ain't ever getting older)\n(We ain't ever getting older)\n(No, we ain't ever getting older)\n\n.........\n📷 Wallpaper: https://unsplash.com/\n.........\n📧Contact: monstafluffmusicnetwork@gmail.com\n.........\n\n#TheChainsmokers #Closer #Lyrics #Halsey",

Some of the new songs that don't have deep house remixes, bass house, Brazilian or g-house we make a boosted bass mix version for you to enjoy the music like a gangster in your car.\n\nThis music movement started a few years ago, but now it gets bigger with each passing day, and we can find a lot of channels that promote car bass video. Some of the best we find are Car Music, Gangster club, Bass Movement, House Music HD, Gangster City, Alex's list, Lithuania HQ.\n\nMuch of the music is composed and orchestrated in the Jhaps Records gang studios, while also seeking to promote young producers and their remixes.\n\nListen to our new music while playing online games or free internet online games from the app store or google play. From Las Vegas to Hollywood, Dubai to Moscow, you gonna watch our online music videos more than HBO or Netflix :).\n\nIt's incredible how the new bass house tracks like Shadow form the Romanian producer Triplo Max, \nUgg'A with the bomb Think About, TRFN in collaboration with  Fella with the song Drive all these with Siadou too... The best hit tracks from Ilkay Sencan with \"No Sweat\" popular song, but also with  Rockstar, the recent one Not so BAd, the very new collaboration with Era Istrefi and Arash - No Maybes, that probably will break the radio playlists. We all loved to listen to new trap music in our cars, but the new trend with bass house G house it's crazy. This style started in Russia, Ukraine, Germany, or France, but now it's viral in England too. We also remember about nebezao with the house music hit smash Rompasso, with angetenar, kvpv  fake, rsac,ella. From Busta rhymes and 50 cents, Linkin park with touch it, in the end, candy shop.\nWe also love 2scratch style, and all his songs are amazing starting from reminder, Ex, Loco feat Taog, super hit Superlife with Lox Chatterbox, Sober, Rich all night or deja vu.\n\nFrom JHaps Records music catalog over the years we have released songs that have become hits from Otilia with  songs  in english or spanish reggaeton songs deep house dance music bass boosted remixes car 2020: Bilionera billionaire Adelante otila remix song  Diamante Aventura devocion latina I don't know Balim with Serdar Ortaq, Wine my body, Otilia turkish album with the single Deli Gibi, Azar. Also Y3MR$ made a huge remix for Adelante in february 2020 entitled Adelante Y3MR$ remix.
